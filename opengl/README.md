OpenGL Eiffel Wrapper
=====================

Low level wrappers of the OpenGL libraries.

Those wrappers are autogenerated with the EiffelStudio SWIG plug-in. They are
not well tested nor documented. Every functionnalities have there original
names and you can access the documentations at https://www.opengl.org/sdk/docs/ .

GL library
========

Contain functionnalities of OpenGL up to 1.1.

GLU library
=========

Contain functionnalities of GLU up to 1.2.

GLEW library
===========

Contain functionnalities of OpenGL up to 4.4 and GLU up to 1.2 and GLEW.
Even if the video card of the system does not support a functionnality, the program will
still compile but the call to the functionnality will fail. You can use glewIsSupported
to see if a functionnality is supported by the video card at runtime. glewInit must be used
after the creation of a {GAME_WINDOW_GL}.

Note: You cannot use GL or GLU libraries in the same project than the GLEW library.
